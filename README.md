# Aniumus

**2nd Year Scifi UI**

Module: Object Oriented Programming

Name: Kevin Campbell

Student No.: D17126544

**Instrutions for Use:** 

Pretty simple to use, all the buttons are functional and will open the websites shown in the icon 
as well as the date and time being taken from the systems current date and time.

The background is the piece de resistance of this program using a simple bit of coding to make lines 
appear between particles as they move along the screen to create that animus like effect.

The buttons and sound are also features added which I am proud of as well as the fact that this
particular program is quite usuable for a screensaver or could be converted in the future to a
.ini file to become the actual desktop after more features are added. Something to work on in the
future.
